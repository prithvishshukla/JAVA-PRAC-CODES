# Java Practice Codes 🚀

Welcome to my Java Practice Repository! This collection contains various Java programming examples, data structures implementations, and algorithm solutions that I've worked on while learning Java.

## 📚 Contents

- Basic Java Programs
- Data Structures Implementations
- Algorithm Solutions
- Object-Oriented Programming Examples

## 🔧 Setup

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
2. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JAVA-PRAC-CODES.git
```

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a learning resource and reference for Java programming concepts. Each code file is documented with comments to explain the logic and implementation details.

## 💻 Java Boilerplate Example

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code here
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## 🔄 Basic OOP Structure

```java
class Animal {
    // Properties
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Constructor
    public Animal(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Method
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Some sound");
    }
}
```
